# ChainNest

**ChainNest** is a lightweight, read-only Android app that allows users to explore onchain data on the **Base L2** network in a simple and safe way.

No wallet connection.  
No signatures.  
No private keys.  

Just pure onchain data.

## ✨ What ChainNest Does

ChainNest lets anyone:

- 🔍 Paste an EVM address (0x…)
- 💰 Read **ETH balance** on Base
- 🪙 Read **USDC balance** on Base
- 📦 View the **latest transactions** for that address
- ⛓️ Check the **latest block number**

All data is fetched directly from:
- Base RPC
- Blockscout (Base explorer)
